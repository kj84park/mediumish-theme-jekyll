### I've studied Oauth 2.0 many times.

### As far as I remember,

### When I was a new employee, when I prepared the IDP project early last year, etc.

### I’ve developed biometric authentication stuff, 

### authentication apps for ios, android as a security app developer.

### Since almost that time, I dealt with the client-side, 

### I’ve never deep dived this tech.

### So there are unclear parts in Oauth2.0 for me.

### Anyway, This book has good content regarding Oauth 2.0.

### It is quite deep in content, 

### it was very helpful for understanding because it informed a lot of implementation intentions.

### So I'm very pleased to meet this book. 

### It may give me a lot of improvement my skill.

### Unfortunately, a lot of typos in Korean have been found.

### This was the weakest point of this book.

### 3.5/5
